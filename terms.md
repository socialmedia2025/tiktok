1) Protocol Title

Social Norms Curation in Network Communications on Social Media

2) Objectives*

The project aims to explore how social media mental health influencers shape social influence and establish norms. This includes examining how influencers build relationships with their followers, the types of content that benefit mental health, and the impact of this content on followers’ mental health and well-being.

3) Background*

There is a knowledge gap in understanding how different types of social graphs created by social media platforms impact the effectiveness of social influence and the curation of social norms, and what type of social influence are more effective within various algorithm-driven social network interactions.

Research on the social influence of influencers is crucial for both professional therapists and peer mentors in developing effective digital environments for mental health support. Understanding the mechanisms of social influence and social norms curation across different types of social networks will (1) enhance mental health outcomes on social media and (2) advance theoretical understanding of social media influencer literacy, particularly in the context of mental health.

4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*

All posts related to mental health discussions and information provided through social media platforms’ (TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X, Reddit, etc.) APIs will be collected. All posts will be collected from adults 18 and over.
